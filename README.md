# hugo-mod-open-in-vscode

The module contains two partials, which can be placed before and after any HTML element in your templates which does **not contain a link**. 

## Prerequisites

- A local Hugo project 

- A local vscode installation

## Function

If the local Hugo project is rendered **in server-mode**, the two partials wrap a link around the HTML element. The link starts with `vscode://file` and then follows the full path to the current content file. In Hugoâ€™s production mode, these partials do nothing.
